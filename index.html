       <h1>PAST INCIDENT</h1>
       <p> It is a bit funny incident . During the prepartion time of JEE in 11th class I and my friends use to play with chalks(like  throwing chalks on eachother).one day our sir saw us playing with chalks and then the next day he came  in the class and said  that he knows what  we are doing, so he (without wasting  any time) directly said  that who ever started this game  must get out of the class. The one who started the game accepted that he started the game but he argued with sir ,than after that our whole group of friends were asked to leave the classroom. After 10 min of this incident we requested other sir to request to previous sir to allow us to sit in classrom .At last we were allowed to attend the class  and our group was  named as chalk gang. </p>
